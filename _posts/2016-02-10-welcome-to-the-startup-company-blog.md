Startup Company is A game made by Jonas Hovgaard. It  is an upcoming sandbox business-building game that lets you build the software company of your dreams. You're the owner, you control everything! Code quality, marketing strategy and pricing model - it's all up to you.

The project started in August 2015. It highly inspired by Game Dev Tycoon. 
A lot of the programming was streamed to www.livecoding.tv/jhovgaard  and later also streamed to www.twitch.tv/jhovgaard as well. 

The game built up a small following on those sites and now has about 50 concurrent viewers between the both of them and has reached over 150 unique viewers at once. Jonas has since started to get more and more viewers and help with the stream and social media from great people in the community he built around the game.

Pre-orders are now available and the game is estimated to be released around summer 2016

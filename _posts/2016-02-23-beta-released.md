The past two weeks has been kinda crazy for Startup Company. Jonas decided to take a week off streaming and developing to renovate his kitchen!
Once that was done - He returned to his normal schedule with a bang, Beta 1 was released 20th of February! It's a closed beta for those who have pre-ordered the game.
If you wish to participate in the closed beta, and of course getting the game, you can still pre-order at www.startupcompanygame.com!
 
So what are the main differences between Alpha and Beta?
 
- A completely new UI. It's brighter, quicker and more responsive.
- Graphics rewamped! Jonas hired a new artist which brought a whole new dimension to the art assets!
- Products and features are now a part of the game!
- Research as well to unlock new features!
